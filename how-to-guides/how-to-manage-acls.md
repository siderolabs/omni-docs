# Manage Access Policies (ACLs)

This guide will show how to give the user `support@example.com` full access to the `staging` cluster but limited access to the `production` cluster.
{% hint style="warning" %}
The default without RBAC is to grant Kubernetes admin-level access for users with write permissions on the Omni side.
{% endhint %}
### Create an AccessPolicy resource

Create a local file `acl.yaml`:

```yaml
metadata:
  namespace: default
  type: AccessPolicies.omni.sidero.dev
  id: access-policy
spec:
  rules:
    - users:
        - support@example.com
      clusters:
        - staging
      role: Operator
      kubernetes:
        impersonate:
          groups:
            - system:masters
    - users:
        - support@example.com
      clusters:
        - production
      role: Reader
      kubernetes:
        impersonate:
          groups:
            - my-app-read-only
  tests:
    - name: support engineer has full access to staging cluster
      user:
        name: support@example.com
      cluster:
        name: staging
      expected:
        role: Operator
        kubernetes:
          impersonate:
            groups:
              - system:masters
    - name: support engineer has read-only access to my-app namespace in production cluster
      user:
        name: support@example.com
      cluster:
        name: production
      expected:
        role: Reader
        kubernetes:
          impersonate:
            groups:
              - my-app-read-only
```

As an Omni admin, apply this ACL using omnictl:

```bash
omnictl apply -f acl.yaml
```

When users interact with Omni API or UI, they will be assigned to the role specified in the ACL.

When users access the Kubernetes cluster through Omni, they will have the groups specified in the ACL.

Kubernetes RBAC then can be used to grant permissions to these groups.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only the users who have the Omni role `Admin` can manage ACLs. Users who have the Omni role `Operator` or above are assigned to the Kubernetes role `system:masters` by default, in addition to the ACLs.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Create Kubernetes RBAC resources

Locally, create `rbac.yaml` with a `Namespace` called `my-app`, and a `Role` & `RoleBinding` to give access to the `my-app-read-only` group:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: my-app
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: read-only
  namespace: my-app
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["", "extensions", "apps", "batch", "autoscaling"]
    resources: ["*"]
    verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-only
  namespace: my-app
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: read-only
subjects:
  - kind: Group
    name: my-app-read-only
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

As the cluster admin, apply the manifests to the Kubernetes cluster `production`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
```

### Test the access

Try to access the cluster with a `kubeconfig` generated by the user `support@example.com`:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n my-app
```

The user should be able to list pods in the `my-app` namespace because of the `Role` and `RoleBinding` created above.

Try to list pods in another namespace:

```bash
kubectl get pod -n default
```

The user should not be able to list pods in namespace `default`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the user `support@example.com` has the Omni role `Operator` or above assigned, they will have `system:masters` role in Kubernetes as well as the `my-app-read-only` role.

Therefore, they will still be able to list pods in all namespaces.
