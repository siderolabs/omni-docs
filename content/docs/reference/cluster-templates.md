Cluster templates are parsed, validated, and converted to Omni resources, which are then created or updated via the Omni API.
Omni guarantees backward compatibility for cluster templates, so the same template can be used with any future version of Omni.

All referenced files in machine configuration patches should be stored relative to the current working directory.

## Structure

The Cluster Template is a YAML file consisting of multiple documents, with each document having a `kind` field that specifies the type of the document.
Some documents might also have a `name` field that specifies the name (ID) of the document.

```yaml
kind: Cluster
name: example
kubernetes:
  version: v1.26.0
talos:
  version: v1.3.2
patches:
  - name: kubespan-enabled
    inline:
      machine:
        network:
          kubespan:
            enabled: true
---
kind: ControlPlane
machines:
  - 27c16241-96bf-4f17-9579-ea3a6c4a3ca8
  - 4bd92fba-998d-4ef3-ab43-638b806dd3fe
  - 8fdb574a-a252-4d7d-94f0-5cdea73e140a
---
kind: Workers
machines:
  - b885f565-b64f-4c7a-a1ac-d2c8c2781373
---
kind: Machine
name: 27c16241-96bf-4f17-9579-ea3a6c4a3ca8
install:
  disk: /dev/vda
---
kind: Machine
name: 4bd92fba-998d-4ef3-ab43-638b806dd3fe
install:
  disk: /dev/vda
---
kind: Machine
name: 8fdb574a-a252-4d7d-94f0-5cdea73e140a
install:
  disk: /dev/vda
---
kind: Machine
name: b885f565-b64f-4c7a-a1ac-d2c8c2781373
install:
  disk: /dev/vda
```

Each cluster template should have exactly one document of `kind: Cluster`, `kind: ControlPlane`, and `kind: Workers`.

Every `Machine` document must be referenced by either a `ControlPlane` or `Workers` document.

## Document Types

### `Cluster`

The `Cluster` document specifies the cluster configuration, defines the cluster name and base component versions.

```yaml
kind: Cluster
name: example
kubernetes:
  version: v1.26.1
talos:
  version: v1.3.3
patches:
  - file: patches/example-patch.yaml
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `kind` | string | `Cluster` |
| `name` | string | Cluster name: only letters, digits and `-` and `_` are allowed. The cluster name is used as a key by all other documents, so if the cluster name changes, a new cluster will be created. || `kubernetes.version` | string | Kubernetes version to use, `vA.B.C`. |
| `talos.version` | string | Talos version to use, `vA.B.C`. |
| `patches` | array | List of [patches](#patches) to apply to the cluster. |


{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
Changes to `kubernetes.version` and `talos.version` do not properly trigger a cluster upgrade at the moment.
{{% /alert %}}


### `ControlPlane`

The `ControlPlane` document specifies the control plane configuration, defines the number of control plane nodes, and the list of machines to use.

As control plane machines run an `etcd` cluster, it is recommended to use a number of machines for the control plane that can achieve a stable quorum (i.e. 1, 3, 5, etc.).
Changing the set of machines in the control plane will trigger a rolling scale-up/scale-down of the control plane.

The control plane should have at least a single machine, but it is recommended to use at least 3 machines for the control plane for high-availibility.

```yaml
kind: ControlPlane
machines:
  - 27c16241-96bf-4f17-9579-ea3a6c4a3ca8
  - 4bd92fba-998d-4ef3-ab43-638b806dd3fe
  - 8fdb574a-a252-4d7d-94f0-5cdea73e140a
patches:
  - file: patches/example-controlplane-patch.yaml
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `kind` | string | `ControlPlane` |
| `machines` | array | List of machine IDs to use for control plane nodes. |
| `patches` | array | List of [patches](#patches) to apply to the machine set. |

### `Workers`

The `Workers` document specifies the worker configuration, defines the number of worker nodes, and the list of machines to use.

```yaml
kind: Workers
machines:
  - b885f565-b64f-4c7a-a1ac-d2c8c2781373
patches:
  - file: patches/example-workers-patch.yaml
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `kind` | string | `Workers` |
| `machines` | array | List of machine IDs to use for worker nodes. |
| `patches` | array | List of [patches](#patches) to apply to the machine set. |

### `Machine`

The `Machine` document specifies the install disk and machine-specific configuration patches.
They are optional, but every `Machine` document must be be referenced by either a `ControlPlane` or `Workers` document.

```yaml
kind: Machine
name: 27c16241-96bf-4f17-9579-ea3a6c4a3ca8
install:
  disk: /dev/vda
patches:
  - file: patches/example-machine-patch.yaml
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `kind` | string | `Machine` |
| `name` | string | Machine ID. |
| `install.disk` | string | Disk to install Talos on, default value is `/dev/sda`. |
| `patches` | array | List of [patches](#patches) to apply to the machine. |

## Common Fields

### `patches`

The `patches` field is a list of [machine configuration patches](https://www.talos.dev/latest/talos-guides/configuration/patching/) to apply to a cluster, a machine set, or an individual machine.
Config patches modify the configuration before it is applied to each machine in the cluster.
Changing configuration patches modifies the machine configuration which gets automatically applied to the machine.

```yaml
patches:
  - file: patches/example-patch.yaml
  - name: kubespan-enabled
    inline:
      machine:
        network:
          kubespan:
            enabled: true
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `file` | string | Path to the patch file. Path is relative to the current working directory when executing `omnictl`. File should contain Talos machine configuration strategic patch. |
| `name` | string | Name of the patch. Required for `inline` patches, optional for `file` patches (default name will be based on the file path). |
| `inline` | object | Inline patch containing Talos machine configuration strategic patch.  |

A configuration patch may be either `inline` or `file` based.
Inline patches are useful for small changes, file-based patches are useful for more complex changes, or changes shared across multiple clusters.
