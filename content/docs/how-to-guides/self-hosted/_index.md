Omni is available as a hosted version operated by Sidero Labs, but can also be self-hosted.
This is appropriate for:
- air-gapped deployments
- industries with strict security and compliance concerns
- home use.

Note that using Omni for production use requires a commercial license.
Contact sales@SideroLabs.com for more information.
Non-production use, such as using Omni for a home lab, does not require a license.
