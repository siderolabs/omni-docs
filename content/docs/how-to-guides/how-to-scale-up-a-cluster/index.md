From the list of available machines that is shown, identify the machine or machines you wish to add, and then click "ControlPlane" or "Worker", to add the machine with that role.
You may add multiple machines in one operation.
Click "Add Machines" when all machines have been selected to be added.

The cluster will now scale up.
